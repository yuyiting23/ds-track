Principles of Analytics Graphics

1. Show cmaparision
    * Control vs Experiment gorup to compare evidence between 2 hypotheses
    (Control vs Air Cleaner, y = change in symptom-free days)

2. Show causality, mechanism, explanation
    * Make an explanation to show what's going on
    * How you believe the world/ system works
    * What's the casual framework for thinking about the question
    (Control vs Air Cleaner, y = change in PMs) - Relationship: Negative

    change in symptom-free days ~ change in PMs?? 

3. Show multivariate data
    * Show as much as data on a single plot as you can
    * The world is inherently multivariant
    * Try to tell a much richer story
     (Spring, x = PM concentration, y = Daily Mortality) - Relationship: Postive
     (Summer, x = PM concentration, y = Daily Mortality) - Relationship: Postive
     (Fall, x = PM concentration, y = Daily Mortality)   - Relationship: Postive
     (Winter, x = PM concentration, y = Daily Mortality) - Relationship: Postive
     Overall,Relationship: Negative --> Symptoms Paradox 
     Explanation: Confounding, 
        Season in confounding with the relationship between PMs and mortality

    * It's imoprtant to show as many as variabls as reasonable at a time, so that you will have a clear picture of the evidence.


4. Integrate multiple models of evidence
    * Completely integrate words, numbers, images, diagrams
    * Combine different modes of evidence to build single presentation, as information rich as possible 

5. Describe and document the evidence
    * labels, scales, sources...
    * credibility

6. Content is king
    * What's the story you want to tell
    * What's the data you have
    * How are you going to present it
    * How is it gonna look like
